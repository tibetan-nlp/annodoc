title: Dependency grammar

Our annotation guidelines follow the UD project in privileging content words over
function words. Instead of linking a predicate to the function word (for example, the case
marker) that marks its argument, we link the predicate to the content head word (for example,
the head noun) of the argument. Function words then depend on the content words which they "modify".

The UD project maintains that there is an advantage to this approach:

> Preferring content words as heads maximizes parallelism between languages because content words vary less than function words between languages. In particular, one commonly finds the same grammatical relation being expressed by morphology in some languages or constructions and by function words in other languages or constructions, while some languages may not mark the information at all (such as not marking tense or definiteness).

This advantage is also evident when investigating a single language from
a diachronic perspective. LIM examines predicate-argument structure in Old,
Classical, and Modern Tibetan - a period spanning over a millennium, and one
that witnessed significant changes in argument and predicate marking.
A particular predicate might mark its agent with agentive case at one stage,
and no case at another stage. Viewing predicate-argument annotation
as a relation between content words allows us both to abstract over such differences and
to describe them in a systematic way.
