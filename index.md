title: LIM Annotation Documentation  
---

This site documents the annotation scheme for
Tibetan language texts used by the project *Lexicography in Motion* (LIM)
based at SOAS University of London and the Bavarian Academy of Sciences
and Humanities (_Bayerische Akademie der Wissenschaften_) in Munich.
The project is focused on verbs.  Our primary objective is to
annotate the predicate-argument structure of verbs in the service
of building a corpus-based Tibetan verb lexicon.

Where possible, our annotation scheme follows the guidelines of the
[Universal Dependencies](http://universaldependencies.org/) project.
