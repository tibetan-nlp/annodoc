title: Complex predicates
---
Butt (2010:49) defines a *complex predicate* as:

> a construction that involves two or more predicational elements
> (such as nouns, verbs, and adjectives) which predicate as a single unit,
> i.e. their arguments map onto a monoclausal syntactic structure.

A *complex verb* is then a complex predicate where all (or more usually
both) predicates are verbs. In contrast, an auxiliary is a non-predicational
element that merely contributes TAME (tense, aspect, mood and evidentiality)
to a sentence.
