In the above cases, which are typical examples of light verbs, the `NOUN`
fills an argument position without introducing additional arguments. However,
in other cases that we have found, the noun in a light verb construction
causes the valency of the verb to change, introducing another otherwise
unlicensed argument. For example, ཡོད་ itself occurs surprisingly as a light
verb in the following example:

~~~ ann

A110a Number T110 Sing

Here, `arg1:lvc` is རྒྱས་ "knowledge" and `arg2` is ཡི་གེ་ "letter".
