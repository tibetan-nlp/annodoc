title: arg1 
shortdef: the first argument or "subject" of a verb, which may be agentive or unmarked, but not oblique
---

The sole argument of a one-place predicate is marked `arg1`.

Although verbs of motion can occur with a variety of adpositional phrases,
specifying source, destination, and so on, we classify their canonical
use as sole argument verbs. Adpositional phrases
should be linked to motion verbs as oblique modifiers rather than
as arguments, using the [`obl`](http://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/obl.html)
relation.

Another example of a single argument verb in many of its uses is ཡོད་.
