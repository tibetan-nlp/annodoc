title: cop 
shortdef: a verb which provides support to a non-verbal main predicate
---
In a copular linking construction, we use the
[`cop`](http://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/cop.html)
relation to link a predicate
(e.g. an adjective) to the `x` or `x n`. The copula itself does not have an
argument structure.
