title: obl 
shortdef: an oblique nominal that modifies a verb
---

We use the [`obl`](http://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/obl.html) relation
to mark unmarked nominals that act as adverbials, and arguments marked with
adpositions other than agentive case, regardless of whether or not they are
considered to be arguments of the verb.
