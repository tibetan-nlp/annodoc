title: aux
shortdef: a verb which follows and functionally modifies the main verb

The [`aux`](http://universaldependencies.org/u/dep/aux_.html)
relation is used to link functional auxiliaries to main verbs.
We adhere to the [UD guidelines](http://universaldependencies.org/u/overview/syntax.html)
regarding stacked auxiliaries:
> ... multiple function words related to the same content word always appear as siblings, never in a nested structure, regardless of their interpretation. A typical case is that of auxiliary verbs, which never depend on each other.

When used in periphrastic constructions to mark tense or aspect,
copulas (`x` and `x n`) also depend on main verbs or verbal nouns via
the `aux` relation.
